== Description ==

Wordpress/Plugin Upgrade Time Out Plugin allows you to modify the files download time out value (mainly used for upgrade of Wordpress and Plugins). No more requiring to modify after every Wordpress upgrade.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `upgrade-time-out.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. (Optional) You can change the settings for the time out value. This is optional as I've set it to 60 as a default value. Change to a larger value if required.
4. And when you thought there were more steps, we're done.
